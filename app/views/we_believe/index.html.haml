      %p Life puts atoms together in very interesting ways. One configuration of atoms gives us an ant carrying a leaf many times larger than itself. From another configuration we get an eagle slipping gracefully through the sky. Yet another configuration becomes a person who feels, thinks, and loves.

      %p Without Life, the energy from our sun simply bounces off the planet. Life literally collects the energy Sol sends to earth, and stores it up for future use. Plants take energy from Sol and convert it into denser, more storable forms. The sugars and fats that our bodies burn are little pools of energy that originally came from our sun.

      %p Ants carrying, eagles soaring, people loving &hellip; none of these would exist without Life's awesome capacity for organizing matter.

      %p Life is not perfect. This is obvious to anyone who has experienced cruelty or misfortune. And yet, Life is the only game in town. Without Life the Earth would be just another dead ball of rock.

      %p Nothing needs to change for Life to become &ldquo;worthy&rdquo;. It already is worthy. Even if we had more wars, more hunger, and more systemic injustice, Life would still be precious. Always and forever, Life is what it is &hellip; and it is worthy of veneration!

      %p It is the nature of Life to flower and spread. During the Devonian 420 million years ago, Life burst out of the sea and took root on land. The adaptive radiation that followed drove an upward spiral of innovation, dramatically increasing the diversity of Life.

      %p Complex Life exists even though our universe is strongly biased toward decay and collapse. Scientists call the tendency for things to run down the &ldquo;second law of thermodynamics.&rdquo; Since the beginning of Life on our planet, effectively every organism has died and every species has gone extinct (&gt; 99.9%).

      %p Life is a process that sometimes creates an upward eddy in the downward current of destruction dictated by the second law. Life created the diversity we see today from countless individuals making countless contributions across countless generations.

      %p Arete is a Greek word that means living up to our potential and fulfilling our purpose. When we say &ldquo;the Arete of Life&rdquo; we mean the complex whole of Life, including the upward spiral of creation and the myriad deaths and extinctions that give rise to that spiral. We celebrate it all.

      %p Ants carrying, eagles soaring, people loving &hellip; none of these would exist without Life's erratic yet tenacious upward spiral of creation.

    %h3 SolSeed: The Body of All Life

    .commentary

      %p Groups of people may be organized into bodies. When we regard a number of individuals as a single entity, we refer to the group as a &ldquo;body&rdquo;. We have legislative bodies, student bodies, administrative bodies, governing bodies, and religious bodies. Bodies are in some way more than the sum of the individuals. We expect a body of people to generate ideas and think about things in a way that is different from what the individuals working alone would come up with.

      %p Groups of cells may also be organized into bodies. The cells in your body don't know who you are and don't care about you. And yet, by each cell doing its own little thing in its own little context, this miraculous thing called you emerges!

      %p Just like our body is composed of cells that each do their own different unique thing, so too there is a body of all life composed of living organisms of which we are a part. This body of all Life has many names. We call it SolSeed. Sol out of gratitude for the star at the center of our system that provides practically all the energy that animates Life on Earth, and Seed to remind us of the tremendous possibilities latent in the complex biosystem Life has created by organizing the gift of energy that comes from Sol.
